Actions speak louder than words.
A watched pot never boils.
Beggars can't be choosers.
Better late than never.
Don't count your chickens before they hatch.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
The squeaky wheel gets the grease.
Time heals all wounds.
Too many cooks spoil the broth.
Two heads are better than one.
You reap what you sow.
Look before you leap.
No pain, no gain.
Practice makes perfect.
Rome wasn't built in a day.
Strike while the iron is hot.
Good things come to those who wait.
Honesty is the best policy.
If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Laughter is the best medicine.
